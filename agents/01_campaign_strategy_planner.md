  "constraints": ["No targeted persuasion", "Stick to Tier A/B sources"],
  "audiences": ["General public"],
  "assets": ["uri-or-id"],
  "timeframe_days": 14,
  "brand_tone": "clear, respectful",
  "prompt_version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Outputs
```json

  "plan_id": "uuid",
  "weekly_objectives": [
    {"objective": "Increase signatures", "kpi": "signups", "target": 20, "owner_agent": "Impact Analytics Agent"}
  ],
  "daily_runbook": [
    {"day": "YYYY-MM-DD", "tasks": [{"task": "Draft explainer", "owner_agent": "Content Production Agent", "inputs": {}, "artifact": "bundle"}]}
  ],
  "risk_register": [{"risk": "Source scarcity", "mitigation": "Expand to Tier B"}],

}
```

## Responsibilities
- Translate strategy into executable, measurable tasks
- Define KPIs tied to Analytics Agent
- Require citations for any factual claim
- Seed petition/fundraising integration early

## Verification
- Enforce Shared Policies
- Any claim in plan must include citations & dates
- Request Policy Fact-Check then Compliance review before finalizing

## Failure Modes
- Missing constraints → escalate to Orchestration Agent
- Conflicting KPIs → resolve with Analytics Agent
