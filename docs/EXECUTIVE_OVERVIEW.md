# Is There Enough Money — AI Agent Automation Framework

Mission: eliminate the US national debt within 8 years by shifting taxation burden from the "real economy" (work/productive activity) to the "monetary economy" (financial transactions & wealth accumulation).

## Core Messaging (non-targeted, broad)
- **Primary**: Stop Taxing Work. Start Taxing Wealth.
- **Support**: Lift the Burden. Share the Load · A Future Without Debt · Enough Money. Enough Future.
- Identity: Bipartisan, solution-oriented, economic justice, abundance paradigm.

## Specialized Policy Agents (new)
1) **Monetary Economy Analysis** — market/transactions, liquidity, monetary policy impacts.
2) **Tax Reform Advocacy** — policy proposals, advocacy content, legislative outreach logistics.
3) **Debt Elimination Strategy** — model scenarios, track progress to 8-year goal.
4) **Economic Transparency** — public dashboards, disclosure, audit trails.
5) **Real vs Monetary Economy Analysis** — productive vs speculative activity; burden split.
6) **Voter Education** — educational explainers, data viz (non-partisan, non-targeted).
7) **Coalition Building** — org relations & joint advocacy infrastructure.
8) **Media Engagement** — press coordination, coverage monitoring.

## Orchestration & Standards
- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) for cross-agent context + tool access.
- **Five-Pillar Memory Engineering**: policy knowledge | campaign | compliance | stakeholders | performance.
- **FEC/Compliance Gates**: legal review, coordination restrictions, privacy, accessibility.
- **Failure Prevention**: circuit breakers, retries, deterministic fallbacks, audit trails.
- **No targeted persuasion**: messaging remains broad and non-discriminatory.

## KPIs (high-level)
- Debt reduction trajectory; policy influence; public engagement & comprehension; coalition growth; media accuracy & sentiment.
